       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",

## 🛡️ Security and Best Practices

- **Authentication**: Only authenticated users can access chat functionality.
- **Database Rules**: Firebase Realtime Database is secured with proper rules:
  ```json
  {
    "rules": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
  ```
